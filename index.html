      <ul class="rules">
        <li>The game is a simplified version of the Simon game.</li>
        <li>When the user starts the game, a button is initially pressed .</li>
        <li>
          The user's objective is to replicate the sequence of buttons pressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          After pressing the initial button, the level increases and adds
          another button to the sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user must remember and reproduce the entire sequence correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          As the game progresses, the level continues to increase, adding more
          buttons to the sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user's task is to press the buttons in the correct order,
          following the entire sequence from the beginning.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the user makes a mistake by pressing the buttons out of order, the
          game ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal is to achieve the highest level possible by accurately
          replicating the sequences.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game provides an enjoyable challenge to test and improve the
          user's memory and sequencing skills.
        </li>
